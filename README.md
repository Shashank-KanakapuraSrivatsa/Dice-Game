# Dice-Game

**This simple game was created to showcase my JavaScript skills - To demonstrate how DOM manipulation works.**

**Dice Game allows 2 players to play. It rolls the dice and decides who is the winner. This can be used in situations where a decision has to be made - can be used as a replacement to coin tossing - or - can be used just to have some fun. Enjoy!!**
